# A bookmarklet to remove ads from twitter timeline

## Motivation

Recently, [Adblock Plus](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/adblock-plus-free-ad-bloc/cfhdojbkjhnklbpkdaibdccddilifddb) no longer blocks Twitter ads, causing my timeline to look ugly when browsing Twitter on Chrome browser. I understand Twitter is in a difficult situation, but I hate ads displayed in the timeline because they interfere with my browsing experience. (Anything that appears next to the main content is no matter since it does not get in the way.) That's why I decided to remove the ads on my timeline myself.

## Usage

1. Add a bookmark to your browser, and put the content of [bookmarklet_en.js](bookmarklet_en.js) in the URL field.

1. Click the bookmark created above when you're annoyed by the ads on Twitter timeline. This will make you feel better!

## Note

[bookmarklet_en.js](bookmarklet_en.js) works only in English. If you are using a language other than English, replace the `"Promoted"` at the end of the scripts with your language.
