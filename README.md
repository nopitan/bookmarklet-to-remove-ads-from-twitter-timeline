# A bookmarklet to remove ads from twitter timeline

## Motivation

Recently, [Adblock Plus](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/adblock-plus-free-ad-bloc/cfhdojbkjhnklbpkdaibdccddilifddb) no longer blocks Twitter ads, causing my timeline to look ugly when browsing Twitter on Chrome browser. I understand Twitter is in a difficult situation, but I hate ads displayed in the timeline because they interfere with my browsing experience. (Anything that appears next to the main content is no matter since it does not get in the way.) That's why I decided to remove the ads on my timeline myself.

## Usage

Add a bookmark to your browser, and put the content of [bookmarklet_ja.js](bookmarklet_ja.js) in the URL field.

## Note

This [bookmarklet_ja.js](bookmarklet_ja.js) works only in Japanese. If you are using a language other than Japanese, replace the `"promotion"` at the end of the scripts with your language.
